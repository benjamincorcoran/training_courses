    "# Recap of Day 1\n",
    "\n",
    "A brief recap of what we covered in day 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Numeric values - Integers (`int`; Whole numbers), Floating-point numbers (`float`; Decimals)  \n",
    "Text values - String (`str`; given in 'single quote' or \"speech marks\")  \n",
    "Logical values - Booleans (`bool`; `True` or `False` values)  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is object-oriented, all general data types (numerics, strings, booleans) and data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries) are objects. Objects have properties and methods. Properties are data stored by the object, and methods are behaviours, procedures or functions that can be performed by the object to produce an output, often with respect to the properties of the object itself. Objects are extensible, this means that programmers can take very general data structures and produce specialised objects that are useful for particular purposes, like the Series and DataFrame objects that Pandas implements to make data science easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we create an object we create a specific 'instance' of it, usually with some specific data. We store this new object in memory as a named variable. This name is called the object's identifier and allows us to reuse that object for as long as it remains in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we name an object, the name can't start with numbers, contain special characters (e.g. ^, %, & etc.) or be a reserved word like `list` or `True` which mean something particular to python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessing the properties and methods of objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Some special functions built-in to python allow you to directly access the properties and methods of objects, such as the `str()` function which gets a string representation of an object, or the `len()` which returns the length of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, most of the properties and methods of a function are accessed using '.' (dot notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, getting the rows and columns of a pandas DataFrame:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nrows, ncols = df.shape\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the code above, I have a DataFrame called `df`, I get the number of rows and columns in `df` using the `shape` property with `df.shape`. This property returns a tuple, which I 'unpack' and store in two variables `nrows` and `ncols`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that `shape` is a property of a DataFrame because it is just a word, there are no parentheses (brackets) after it. Compare it to:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "veg = ['carrot','carrot','parsnip','cabbage','carrot']\n",
    "veg.count('carrot')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above code, we make a list called `veg` which contains several string objects. We then call a list method on `veg` called `count()`, which counts the number of occurances of a given parameter in the list. The parameter we use is `'carrot'` which matches 3 items in `veg`, we thus expect the output 3 from the `count()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pandas Essentials\n",
    "\n",
    "### `import` the pandas module\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been using pandas, which is a powerful python module for data reading, writing and wrangling. By convention we import pandas into python using:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "`pd` is a commonly using nickname or 'alias' for pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Read Data Using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas has a load of built in file readers, they are all prefixed with `.read`, you can look them up with the tab key and use the one you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you read data into python and assign it to a variable, we refer to that object as a 'DataFrame'.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic = pd.read_csv('../Data/titanic.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export Data Using pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas can export DataFrame or Series objects to a range of different data formats, they are all prefixed with `.to`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic.to_excel('../Save/titanic.xlsx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Select Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "* Select a single column by indexing with the column name.\n",
    "* Select multiple columns by indexing with a list of column names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic['survived'] # single column, returning a Series\n",
    "titanic[['survived','pclass']] # multiple columns, returning a DataFrame\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Filter Rows\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows are filtered by creating a 'Boolean mask', effectively a row-by-row list of `True` or `False` values that determine whether a row is included or excluded in the filtered dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Boolean masks are defined by setting a condition on the values in a given column.\n",
    "* Multiple conditions can be combined using 'and' or 'or' operators which are given by `&` and `|` respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common conditions include:\n",
    "* `==` is 'equal to'.\n",
    "* `!=` is 'not equal to'.\n",
    "* `>` and `>=` are 'greater than', and 'greater than or equal to'.\n",
    "* `<` and `<=` are 'less than', and 'less than or equal to'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some useful functions, including:\n",
    "* `.isin()` takes a list and return a `True` value for any row with a column value in that list.\n",
    "* `between()` takes an upper and lower value, and returns `True` for any row with a column value between those values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the 'tilde' `~` inverts, or negates whatever filter condition you have specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic[titanic['survived'] == 0] # single condition filter\n",
    "titanic[(titanic['survived'] == 0) & (titanic['pclass'] > 1)] # multiple condition filter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chained Indexing\n",
    "Remember we can combine column selection and row filtering in what is known as 'chained index'.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic[(titanic['survived'] == 0) & (titanic['pclass'] > 1)]['survived'] # returns a Series\n",
    "```\n",
    "The order in which you chain operations doesn't matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generate New Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways to create new variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "New columns can be created directly based on arithmetic operations like + - / \\* \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic['family'] = titanic['sibsp'] + titanic['parch']  \n",
    "```\n",
    "Binary variable can be created with conditions\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic['child'] = (titanic['age'] < 18).astype(int)\n",
    "```        \n",
    "Continuous variables can be classified using `pd.cut()` or `pd.qcut()`\n",
    "```python\n",
    "titanic['fare_tertiles'] = pd.qcut(titanic['fare'], 3, ['low','mid','high'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, variables can be removed using the `del` statement, or the `.drop()` method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "del titanic['survived'] # delete a column\n",
    "titanic.drop(columns=['survived','embarked'], inplace = True)\n",
    "```"

Sometimes we find that data we expect to be numeric is actually string data, often occurs because the numbers are actually stored as text in the original dataset, in which case they have to be converted. Other times it is because the original dataset includes characters that pandas won't immediately interpret as a numeric value. This is particularly the case if a dataset contains missing data that is coded to a special character. Reading in these data as text is the safest option, as it preserves all of the information and requires the data analyst to make a decision as to how to handle the conversion to a numeric data type.\n",

    "* Split - a dataframe is divided into a set of smaller dataframes based on the grouping variable.\n",
    "* Apply - an aggregation is applied to each of the groups to create a single row for each group in the original dataframe.\n",
    "* Combine - bring together the aggregated dataframe rows into a final new dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what that might look like for the `titanic` dataframe:\n",
    "* Firstly, we decide to **split** the data by the 'pclass'. This divides the `titanic` dataframe into effectively three separate dataframes, one for first, one for second and one for third class.\n",
    "* Secondly, we **apply** an aggregation to the dataframe. You can either produce an aggregate statistic for all rows, or you can selected specific columns on which to do the aggregation. If we **apply** a `.mean()` aggregation to 'fare', then for each 'pclass' group we get the average fare cost.\n",
