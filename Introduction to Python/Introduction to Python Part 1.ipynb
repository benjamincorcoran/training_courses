    "* Familiarise yourself with the Jupyter notebook, which is what we'll use to interact with python\n",
    "* Learn about python's basic data types - integers, floats, strings and Booleans.\n",
    "* Explore python's general data structure objects - lists, tuples, and dictionaries.\n",
    "* Take a first look at 'pandas', python's data manipulation and analysis library.\n",

    "* Python is interoperable across multiple computing platforms (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux)\n",
    "* Used by many people, giving it a large user base.\n",
    "* Open-source - It is much more cost effective and easier to maintain than SAS and SPSS\n",
    "* Extensible - A broad range of modules: Data Management, Visualisation, Statistics, Machine Learning, Scientific Computing...\n",
    "* High-level - Concise expressions compared to low-level languages (e.g. c, java etc.) giving greater productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of different ways of interacting with python, in fact your anaconda install gives you three different options:\n",

    "\n",
    "Object is the general name for data types, data structures, functions and so on that python stores in memory and references with an identifier. Technically, an object is a specific instance of a 'class', which is an abstract template for a data type, data structure etc. A class is a pattern for creating new objects that can be reused and extended.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "days_list = [\"Mon\", \"Tues\", \"Weds\", \"Thurs\", \"Fri\", \"Sat\", \"Sun\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "`days_list` is the identifier for a python 'list' data structure (object) that in this case stores some text values.\n",
    "\n",
    "All objects have properties and methods, which relate to data that the object stores and behaviours (procedures) that can be performed on the object to get a specific output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing the properties and methods of an object usually means using the '.' (dot notation). This means we type the name of the object we are interested in, put a dot, then type the name of the property or method we want to call.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, calling the `clear()` method of a list object named `fruit` would be achieved like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit.clear()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This would have the effect of removing any items stored by the list `fruit`, emptying the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we wanted to use the count method to count the number of times a particular item occured in a list, we might do the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruit = ['apple','apple','banana','orange'] # create a list called fruit.\n",
    "fruit.count('apple') # count the number of times that the string 'apple' occurs in the fruit list\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the above, we would expect the `.count()` method, with the parameter 'apple' to return the value 2, because 'apple' appears twice in the list `fruit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are some special in-built python functions that interact with objects and perform special behaviours, like `print()` and `len()`, or the numeric functions (e.g. `pow()`) you've seen already.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, calling the python `print()` function enables us to print a representation of an object based on how a given object behaves with respect to that function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "* The python list object is (possibly) the most versatile of the built in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can hold any sequence of objects, including mixes of objects like strings, integers and Boolean variables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can also hold other lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They can also hold custom data structures, and can be used to create custom data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists are generally created, or 'instantiated', using square brackets `[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new list is considered to be an 'instance' of the list object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each item in the list is separated by a comma.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lists can be amended (they are 'mutable' - they can be changed).\n",

    "\n",
    "The data structures above, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, are the core, in-built data structures available in python. They are always available for use and easily created and destroyed. They are general purpose which means they are useful in many situations, however, they may not always be able to do everything we want them to do for specific purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it is really important to know a bit about lists, tuples and dictionaries because they are used throughout python, and you will be very likely to encounter them in some form. Perhaps as an output from a function or method; as a way of providing input to a procedure; or, as the way that the package you are using stores properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many advanced python libraries that have been built for specific purposes, like data science, take advantage of the fact that objects are extensible. Programmers can create new classes based on existing objects and add in specific properties or methods that do specific things. This means that general purpose objects can be customised for particular tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science applications, the Pandas library provides specialised objects that make working with data tables a lot easier than if we had to rely on python's general purpose objects. However, because pandas objects are specialised, they are also more complicated than general purpose objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Pandas Library - Objects for Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas adds two important data structures that we need to know about. The 1 dimensional `Series` and the 2 dimensional `DataFrame`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Series Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Series is like a one-dimensional array (effectively a list) with a label for each observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can think of a Series as being similar to a single column in a spreadsheet: a list of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, the items in a Series must all be of the same data type, unlike a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series index provides a label for each observation, the default is for consecutive integer labels starting at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "* However, a Series index does not have to be consecutive numbers, they can be non-unique numbers, non-consecutive numbers, as well as string objects or tuples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* As such, the Series itself is a bit like a list, whereas the Series index is a bit like a dictionary, and is able to return a value in the Series based on the index, like a key-value pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Series object implements a large number of special behaviours (methods, procedures) that can be called on the data held in a Series to get useful outputs. This includes mathematical functions, like taking the average of all values in a numerical Series.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  DataFrame Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is a two-dimensional version of a Series object.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In effect, a DataFrame is a collection of Series objects - one Series for each column in the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame is thus similar to a whole spreadsheet, like an Excel file, a STATA .dta file, a SAS file, an SPSS .sav file etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A DataFrame can hold columns with different data types, but as per Series above, any single column must contain vlaues of the same data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The dimensions are labeled in a similar way to the Series object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **index** - refers to the row labels\n",
    "    * **columns** - refers to the column labels\n",
    "    \n",
    " * Having indexed data allows fast look up and powerful relational operations \n",
    " \n",
    " * Each row has a label and each column has a label\n",
    "\n",
    "Most the the time you'll be working with DataFrame objects in Pandas, however, as DataFrames are composed of Series, it is very likely that through indexing, selection, creation of new columns, and analysis you'll encounter Series objects too. Luckily, DataFrame and Series objects are similar, DataFrames effectively extend the Series into two-dimensions and as such implement some additional properties and methdos that may not be relevant to Series on their own."

    "Note that this is identical to slicing a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can't get individual rows by indexing as we would with a list, because a column could be named with an integer. This would mean that `dataframe[0]` is ambiguous and could refer to the first row, or a column named 0. Hence it is not allowed, `dataframe[0]` only works if you have a column named '0', which is a default for some operations in pandas.\n",

    "\n",
    "The way that pandas filters rows can be though of as a two-step process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a 'mask' that specifies inclusion and exclusion for each row in the dataframe.\n",
    "2. Mask the dataframe to return the subset of rows that are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sounds a bit abstract, so let's consider what this might look like in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have the following (very simple) dataframe, called 'catdog':\n",

    "\n",
    "```python \n",
    "mask = catdog['Animal'] == 'Cat'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of = (equals) in the above statement.\n",
    "* The first = indicates assignment, we are assigning the outcome of the expression on the right to the variable on the left of the equals sign.\n",
    "* The second double equals sign, ==, indicates a comparison, in this case it assesses whether each value in the 'Animal' column of catdog is equal to the text 'Cat'. If python finds that the column value and 'Cat' are the same it assigns a True value, and if not a False value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This produces a 'mask' which is a Series of `True` and `False` values against the DataFrame index.\n",
    "\n",
    "index | &#xfeff;\n",

    "\n",
    "* .isin(list) which we can use for multiple conditions \n",
    "* .between() which we can use to specify upper and lower bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the ~ (tilde) allows us to flip or invert an expression. Basically, if an expression returns `[True, True, False]`, the same expression with a ~ in front of it will return `[False, False, True]`.\n",
